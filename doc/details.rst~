How it works
------------

Getting good priors from a single correlator is possible due to the nice properties of correlation functions in QCD. 
The effective mass of a single correlator gives a good estimate of the true mass for example. We first take the sacrificed correlator and perform a second-order superaverage

:math: 'C(t) \to { C(t-1) - 2*C(t) + C(t+1) \over 4 }'

This drowns out any effects from oscillating states in the case of staggered quarks. Then, the prior for the ground state energy is calculated via

:math: 'E_0 = {1\over T_{lat}/2 - 2t_{cut}}  \sum_{t=t_{cut}}^{T_{lat}/2-t_{cut}} \log\left({ C(t)\over C(t+1) }\right)'

The variance of this is inflated by 30% (one can choose a custom amount using the optional argument "loosener").
t_cut is another optional argument, with a default of T_lat/10.

Similarly, the ground state amplitude is given by

:math: 'a_0 = {1\over T_{lat}/2 - 2t_{cut}}  \sum_{t=t_{cut}}^{T_{lat}/2-t_{cut}} \sqrt{ C(t) * e^{ E_0 t } }' * 30% additional error

The excited state parameters are computed by transforming the correlator :math: 'C(t) \to C(t) - a_0^2 * e^{ - E_0 t }',
then finding :math: 'E_0' and :math: 'a_0' values in the same way as above on this transformed correlator.

Priors for oscillaing states are guessed from knowledge of the non-oscillating states, i.e. basically the same with larger errors.

3-point amplitudes are estimated using the ratio

:math: 'R = {1\over T_{lat}/2 - 2t_{cut}}  \sum_{t=t_{cut}}^{T_{lat}/2-t_{cut}} C_{3pt}(t)/ C_{2pt,1}(t) * C_{2pt,2}(T-t),

where the C_{2pt,1/2} are the correlators for the two states on either side of the current. t is the timeslice of the current and T is the source/sink temporal separation. This ratio is equal to J/a1*a2, where J is the transition amplitude and a1/2 are the amplitudes of the 2-point correlators. Then we find J = R * a1 * a2. The rest of the 3-point priors, those coupling to oscillating states and excited states, are generically set to 0.0(1.0).

Some Tests
----------

I ran some tests.

This is the ground state energy of a D_s meson, computed using the HISQ action on the MILC 2+1+1 ensembles. N_subset is the number of points used
to deduce priors, which are shown in blue. The black points are fit results from fitting 986-N_subset correlators using corrfitter, using these
priors. I ran each test 5 times (hence 5 points per N_subset choice), each with a different randomly chosen subset.

Here is the same thing for the ground state amplitude:

And for a 3-point amplitude of a scalar current between a Ds meson and a heavy-strage meson (with heavy mass = 0.5):
